- The OO design is a real MESS. Most of it is easy to fix without breaking the
  API (started)
- coldef_strategy is an ugly hack. This API should be redone for a 2.0 release.  
- nicer examples.pdf (started)
- maybe move csv2pdf and ltpretty in an extra package, because they introduce
  dependencies. But hey, we use Moose which requires half of CPAN anyway...
- fine tune default parameters
- shortcut for multirows
- csvpdf should support all LT options 
- csv2pdf should maybe use my Text::CSV::R module
- ltpretty and csv2pdf should support a config file
