=head1 NAME

ltpretty - Use LaTeX::Table from within your text editor.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ltpretty < lazytable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program takes a I<lazy formatted> LaTeX table from STDIN (typically piped
from Vim or emacs) and outputs a completely formatted table.

=head1 LAZY FORMAT

The first line must contain the L<LaTeX::Table> options (separated by 
semicolons C<;>) in the format C<optionname=value>. The
second line must contain the header, the following lines the data. 
Columns are separated by C<&>. Trailing empty lines are ignored, other 
empty lines generate horizontal rules (as in L<LaTeX::Table>).

=head1 EXAMPLE 

   theme=Meyrin;label=test;position=htb
   Item:2c & Price
   Gnat& per gram& 13.65
   & each& 0.01

   Gnu& stuffed& 92.59
   Emu& stuffed& 33.33
   Armadillo& frozen& 8.99

=head1 VIM

=over 

=item 1. Select the text in C<VISUAL LINE> mode (C<shift+v>). 

=item 2. Type C<!ltpretty>

=back

=head1 EMACS

=over 

=item 1. Select the text

=item 2. Press C<alt+|> 

=item 3. Now "Shell command on region" should appear. Type C<ltpretty>

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

   % theme=Meyrin;label=test;position=htb
   % Item:2c & Price
   % Gnat& per gram& 13.65
   % & each& 0.01
   % 
   % Gnu& stuffed& 92.59
   % Emu& stuffed& 33.33
   % Armadillo& frozen& 8.99
  
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{llr}
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} & Price \\
  \midrule
  Gnat      & per gram & 13.65 \\
            & each     & 0.01  \\
  \midrule          
  Gnu       & stuffed  & 92.59 \\
  Emu       & stuffed  & 33.33 \\
  Armadillo & frozen   & 8.99  \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{test}
  \end{table}


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<ltpretty> does not support configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<LaTeX::Table> 

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Our I<lazy format> does not support multi-line headers. Just add the other
header lines afterwards. More importantly, it currently does not support 
non-scalar L<LaTeX::Table> options like for example C<columns_like_header>.
A future version may add this functionality.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-latex-table@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
